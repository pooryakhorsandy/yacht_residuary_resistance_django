# Yacht Ship Parameter Prediction

## Overview
Welcome to the Yacht Ship Parameter Prediction project! This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict hydrostatic and hydrodynamic parameters of a yacht ship based on three main input parameters: Length (L), Beam, and Draft. By leveraging advanced algorithms, the model aims to provide accurate estimations for various crucial ship characteristics.

## Features
- Predicts hydrostatic parameters such as displacement, waterline length, and longitudinal center of buoyancy.
- Estimates hydrodynamic parameters including prismatic coefficient, block coefficient, and Froude number.
- Input parameters: Length (L), Beam, and Draft.

## How it Works
The machine learning model in this project takes the three main parameters of a yacht ship (Length, Beam, and Draft) as input and employs a trained algorithm to generate predictions for hydrostatic and hydrodynamic parameters. The model has been trained on a dataset that includes a diverse range of yacht ship configurations to ensure robust and accurate predictions.
